"""
model/layers.py

Device-native layer primitives built on model/mlx/ops.py.

V3: activations stay on the GPU between ops. Each function accepts
device-resident gpuarrays and returns device arrays — no host round-trips.
Callers (model/gpt.py) upload once at the forward entry and download only
what backward / logging needs, not after every kernel.
